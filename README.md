# Object Dimension Detector

Object Dimension Detector is an advanced image processing software that calculates the width and volume of objects based on image data. The program outputs object dimensions in pixels, making it an essential tool for tasks requiring precise measurements from images.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Analyze images to detect and measure objects' width and volume with high accuracy.
- **Pixel-Based Output**: Provides dimensions in pixels, ensuring consistent and precise measurements.
- **Volume Estimation**: Estimates the volume of objects when applicable, using detected width and other dimensional data.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Compatible with various image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
